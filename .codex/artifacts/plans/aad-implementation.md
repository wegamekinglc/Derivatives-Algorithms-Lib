# DAL AAD implementation ledger

Status: active implementation. No stage is complete until its correctness, compatibility,
performance, and applicable CI evidence has been inspected.

Controlling design: [detailed AAD plan](https://github.com/wegamekinglc/Derivatives-Algorithms-Lib/blob/9dd9282bb2c517c838a6576a95c9b7a937e750af/.codex/artifacts/plans/aad-improvement-plan.md).
Initial implementation baseline: `b5e3caca85bb1a5b1aa3acf7898b387832d443c8`.

The user authorized full implementation on 2026-10-04 and requires existing functionality
to retain performance and CI compatibility. This ledger preserves the full scope across
incremental implementation turns and PRs; a green first stage does not complete the goal.

## Delivery rules

- Work in isolated writable sources; preserve the original workspace and unrelated changes.
- Establish a failing independent test before each behavioral change.
- Validate native, XAD, CoDiPack, and Adept contracts according to actual adapter capabilities.
- Preserve legacy single-output APIs, units, paths, normalization, and LSM policy semantics.
- Compare isolated Release baseline/head binaries with matching dependency SHAs and configuration.
- Use the existing paired regression policy: ten interleaved process samples per side in each
  of two confirmation rounds, best-of-N minima, and a 4% threshold. Keep all nine existing targets.
- Extend production-workload evidence without weakening or bypassing existing CI/gates.
- Performance failures require investigation and correction. Noisy evidence is inconclusive.
- Keep each change reviewable. Publish current-state documentation only after behavior exists.
- Do not mark the overall goal complete until every applicable requirement below is verified.

## Stage A: trustworthy differentiation and measurement

- [ ] C01: propagate every nonzero scalar adjoint; exact zero is the only default skip.
- [ ] C02: vector channels have independent propagation semantics and match scalar requests.
- [ ] C03: non-finite derivatives/seeds remain observable; public results diagnose invalid risk.
- [ ] C04: preserve consumed intermediate clearing, leaf accumulation, repeated sweeps, and checkpoints.
- [ ] C05: no implicit approximate gradient truncation.
- [ ] P01: correct production-oriented tape/Jacobian/MC benchmarks and explanatory resource metrics.
- [ ] D01: explicit recording lifecycle, checkpoints, nested-use rejection, and exception recovery.
- [ ] D02: optional owner/slot-lifetime diagnostics without release per-node overhead.
- [ ] D03: compile-time backend adapter/capability contracts and verified fallbacks.

## Stage B: market and portfolio risk

- [ ] D04: structured requests/results with stable axes, methods, units, provenance, and budgets.
- [ ] D04: compatibility projections for existing `PV` and `d_...` outputs.
- [ ] F01: deterministic-rate Dupire spread-quote pullback connected to Hybrid valuation gradients.
- [ ] F01: direct quote dependencies and snapshot/axis mismatch validation.
- [ ] F01: calibration-only and full bump/recalibrate/common-path oracles.
- [ ] F01: common calibration pullback integration with existing curve quote-risk semantics.
- [ ] F02: fixed-weight VJP for multiple prepared-script outputs, including aliases/constants.
- [ ] F02: budgeted blocked Jacobian with explicit backend/rerecording behavior.
- [ ] F02: compatible portfolio observation/timeline integration.
- [ ] P02: per-worker capacity reuse and safe re-registration/reinitialization.
- [ ] P03: measured block-width selection and demand-driven result extraction.
- [ ] Bindings: C++ public API, Python keyword/result interfaces, and Excel immutable handles/getters.

## Stage C: structured reverse operators

- [ ] F03: independent linear-solve pullback with decomposition reuse and directional adjoint oracle.
- [ ] F03: recording integration, aliases, multiple seeds, repeated reverse, cache ownership, and failures.
- [ ] F03: structured matrix coordinates and singular/ill-conditioned solver diagnostics.
- [ ] F03: implicit calibration and PDE pullbacks derived and verified separately.
- [ ] P04: proven structural sparsity, safe invalidation, compressed seeds, and mode selection evidence.
- [ ] P05: measured long-path checkpoint with complete state/RNG restoration and recomputation.

## Stage D: second-order risk

- [ ] F04: specified Gamma, cross-Gamma, and Hessian-vector requests using bump-over-AAD.
- [ ] F04: quote-risk second order includes calibration curvature through full recalibration.
- [ ] F04: common-path, smoothing, Frozen/RetrainedBump, and nested-step semantics.
- [ ] F04: mixed-mode prototype on smooth kernels and backend capability validation.
- [ ] F04: estimator validation for applicable simulation/calibration cases before general promotion.

## Completion evidence

- [ ] Focused red/green evidence and independent mathematical references for each feature.
- [ ] Fresh full native/core/public/portable-binding verification.
- [ ] Applicable four-backend verification and exact implementation-head CI checks.
- [ ] Python and Excel parity, generated-source integrity, and documentation integrity.
- [ ] Existing nine-target performance gate plus changed production-workload coverage.
- [ ] Current-state method docs, examples, and necessary changelog entries.
- [ ] Local read-first review with no unresolved correctness or compatibility findings.
- [ ] Requirement-by-requirement audit of the actual final state.

## Current evidence and next action

Isolated sources: `/tmp/dal-aad-baseline` and `/tmp/dal-aad-implementation`.
Evidence/build root: `/tmp/dal-aad-evidence`; dependencies are checked out at baseline gitlink SHAs.
Full native baseline/head Release builds use matching benchmark-enabled configuration.

The first six native propagation regressions failed before the repair and pass afterward.
The native AAD/tape selection passes 54 tests. A fresh full native/core/public/portable-Excel
and non-slow example run passed 2,285 cases before adding the aggregate-overflow regression;
the subsequent full run is pending. Both public finite-payoff/singular-risk recovery and
aggregate-overflow cases pass. No four-backend, remote CI, or performance verdict is claimed yet.

The repair retains the scalar hot loop and consumes intermediate adjoints as before. Public
valuation validates the requested numeric results after simulation, outside per-path loops.
Next: inspect the fresh full-suite result and paired performance gate, address any regression,
then finish backend verification before proceeding to recording and request/result contracts.
